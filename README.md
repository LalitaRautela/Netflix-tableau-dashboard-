In this project, an in-depth analysis of Netflix's content was conducted using Tableau. Netflix, a global streaming giant, produces a vast array of movies and TV shows. The project's scope involved creating various data visualizations and employing filters to allow for a more interactive exploration of the dataset. (Dataset is sourced from Kaggle)

## Objective
The objective of this project was to analyze Netflix's content library using Tableau visualizations. The aim was to **highlight the distribution of content production across countries, identify the most popular genres, explore the rating breakdown**, track the growth of the content library over the years, and understand the distribution between movies and TV shows. Through the utilization of Tableau's interactive features, it provided an engaging platform for viewers to explore the data on their own terms.
